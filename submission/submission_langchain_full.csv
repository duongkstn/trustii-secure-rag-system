6,"How are operational groups identified within a Fabric, and what is the role of Group Identifiers?","Operational groups within a Fabric are identified using Group Identifiers. These identifiers define subgroups within an operational group by distinguishing between different sets of Nodes that share common security contexts but may have varying applications or purposes. Each Node within a subgroup uses its corresponding Group Identifier to prove membership and ensure secure communications with other members of the same subgroup, while still being part of a larger operational group. This allows for finer-grained control over access and communication permissions among different sets of Nodes running similar applications or processes in the Fabric.

The role of Group Identifiers is crucial as they enable the distinction between various subgroups within an operational group, facilitating secure and targeted interactions. By defining distinct Group Identifiers, security domains can be more precisely managed, ensuring that only authorized Nodes can communicate based on their respective identifiers."
