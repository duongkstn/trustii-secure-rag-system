Initially, the Bridge must be set up as a Node on the Matter Fabric. This can typically be done through a Bridge Manufacturer's app or web interface. During this process, the Bridge may need to establish communication with the Matter Fabric and undergo commissioning procedures.

Next, the non-Matter devices that will be represented by the Bridge are connected. These devices must support the communication protocol that the Bridge can convert into the Matter protocol. Once connected, the Bridge Manufacturer's app or interface is used to map these non-Matter devices to appropriate Matter device types supported in the Bridge.

After mapping, the Bridge starts representing the Bridged Devices on the Fabric as clusters within its associated endpoints. The Controller Nodes on the Fabric may then send commands to these clusters, and the Bridge will handle any value updates, events, or commands received from the Bridged Devices, translating them into Matter protocol messages for delivery over the network.

731,Provide an example from the Matter Specification of reading and writing to a fabric-filtered list entry when accessed with a specific fabric.,"When accessing a fabric-scoped list entry with a specific fabric where fabric-filtering is enabled, the interaction will filter the list entries to show only those associated with that particular fabric. For example:

- **Reading from the Fabric-Filtered List**: When a node performs a read interaction on the fabric-scoped list while fabric-filtering is enabled and the node is part of the accessing fabric, it receives a view of the list containing only the entries related to its own fabric. If fabric-filtering is disabled during this read operation, the node gets the full list with all entries.

- **Writing to the Fabric-Filtered List**: Similarly, when performing a write interaction on the fabric-scoped list while fabric-filtering is enabled and the node is part of the accessing fabric, it updates only those entries in the list that are associated with its own fabric. If fabric-filtering were disabled during this operation, the write interaction would fail as the requirement for an accessing fabric would not be met.

912,Do tags within a list need to be unique?,"Tags within a list do not necessarily need to be unique. However, when the Duplicate condition applies, such as for sibling endpoints with Content App device types or affected by specific conditions like multiple independent bridged devices, clients should ensure that each endpoint has a distinct TagList attribute to disambiguate them. In other cases, while tags may help provide additional information, they do not strictly need to be unique unless specified by certain conditions."
913,What privacy-preserving mechanism does Matter employ?,"Matter employs privacy-preserving mechanisms such as unique random node identifiers, session establishment with configurable privacy, non-trackable IP addresses, and optionally encrypting node identifiers in messages to prevent eavesdropping entities from identifying communicating parties."
914,What components comprise the unique identifier in the Groupcast Session Context?,"The unique identifier in the Groupcast Session Context comprises two main components: the Operational Group Key and the Group Session ID. The Group Session ID is derived from the Operational Group Key using a key derivation function (Crypto_KDF) as a big-endian representation of a 16-bit integer, serving as a means for efficiently locating the Operational Group Key used to encrypt an incoming groupcast message. Together, these components ensure message authenticity and prevent replay attacks by enabling receiving nodes to identify potential Operational Group Key candidates without attempting decryption using all available keys."

942,How is a BTP session initiated by the BTP Client?,"Before initiating a BTP session, the BTP Client must first establish a BLE connection with the BTP Server. Once the BLE connection is established, the BTP Client assumes the GATT client role and sends a BTP handshake request to the BTP Server to start the session establishment process. Upon receiving this request, the BTP Server confirms the client’s subscription to C2 and responds with a BTP handshake response via an ATT_HANDLE_VALUE_IND PDU on C2, containing the window size, maximum BTP packet size, and selected BTP protocol version."

949,What is the purpose of receive windows in BTP?,"The purpose of receive windows in BTP is to support flow control by establishing a maximum window size during the handshake between both peers. This mechanism helps manage the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent, preventing session stalling and ensuring efficient data transmission. Receive windows also allow for early packet acknowledgments based on the sequence number difference, which aids in maintaining a smooth data flow. Additionally, when the receive window shrinks to two or fewer free slots, peers send pending acknowledgements immediately to avoid any potential session disruptions."

The focus is mainly on the process of discovering proxies and identifying them through the Subscription Proxy Device Type, or understanding the fields within the Proxy Discover Response Command such as NumHopsToSource. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no direct answer to how these commands are encrypted."
951,Are there any requirements regarding the transaction ID within a transaction?,"Within a transaction, the Transaction ID should be consistent and uniquely identify the transaction.

Since this ID is reserved and never appears in normal protocol usage, any occurrence of such a Nonce would be easily detectable by both the sender and receiver. This makes it unlikely for an attacker to predict or forge valid Nonces, thus providing a level of security against certain types of attacks that rely on guessing or predicting values used in cryptographic protocols."
956,What is a wildcard path?,"A wildcard path contains wildcard endpoint and/or cluster indications, potentially resolving into multiple paths or element instances. Wildcarding is achieved by omission of the respective tag, allowing a request path to be expanded into a list of existent paths, with each wildcard path replaced by a complete list of existent paths.

If KeepSubscriptions is FALSE and a Status Response action with a status code other than SUCCESS is received in response to a Report Data action, the publisher should terminate the Subscribe interaction. Similarly, if a subscription is terminated due to network issues, resets, or resource reclamation, both the publisher and subscriber may need to manage the state of the connection accordingly, potentially leading to the termination of the interaction."
968,How is the Selected Window Size determined in the BTP Handshake Response frame?,"The Selected Window Size in the BTP Handshake Response frame is determined by the server during the handshake process. The server selects this size based on its capabilities and the negotiated parameters with the client. This value, along with the maximum BTP packet size and BTP protocol version chosen by the server, is included in the response to the client's handshake request, sent via a ATT_HANDLE_VALUE_IND PDU."
